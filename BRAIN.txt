Context Snapshot (updated 2025-10-13 01:19Z)
-----------------------------------
- Backend focus: openguild-server crate (Rust, Axum).
- Config hierarchy: config files -> env (OPENGUILD_SERVER__) -> CLI flags.
- Key recent features:
  * Structured ServerConfig loader with metrics + log format options.
  * Prometheus-powered `/metrics` exporter under `--features metrics`, toggled via `OPENGUILD_SERVER__METRICS__ENABLED` (exports `openguild_http_requests_total` + `openguild_db_ready`).
  * Graceful shutdown helper with test-only Notify hook; `run()` now attempts DB connectivity (if DATABASE_URL set) and readiness reports database status (pending/configured/error).
  * CLI overrides via Clap (`--bind-addr`, `--host`, `--port`, `--log-format`, metrics flags, `--database-url`, `--session-signing-key`).
  * Storage crate now exposes a clonable `StoragePool` wrapper (`connect` returns it) plus a SQLx migration smoke test (skips if `OPENGUILD_TEST_DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_URL` unset).
  * Session module in `server` adds `/sessions/login` (JSON) with validation + signed responses using ed25519; backing store now persists to Postgres when a pool is available (falls back to in-memory for credentials-only mode).
  * Messaging core (Week 4): REST CRUD for guilds/channels, optimistic message persistence, and WebSocket fan-out with bounded broadcast/backpressure and replay window. In-memory fallback mirrors semantics when DATABASE_URL is absent.
  * `openguild-core::messaging` introduces message payload builders + proptests to ensure canonical event IDs remain unique; `openguild-storage::messaging` wires SQLx repositories for guilds/channels/events.
  * Integration test (`websocket_broadcasts_events`) exercises fan-out via `tokio_tungstenite` to guard regressions.
- Week 5 observability prep (in flight):
  * No request/span ID propagation yet; plan to add a middleware (likely `tower-http`'s `SetRequestIdLayer` + `PropagateRequestIdLayer`) and expose the ID via response headers + tracing spans so downstream logs/tests can assert correlation.
  * `AppState::record_http_request` relies on hard-coded route labels; consider using `axum::extract::MatchedPath` inside middleware so metrics stay consistent once more routes land.
  * `MetricsContext` currently holds only `http_requests_total` and `db_ready`; extend with histograms (latency), gauges (WebSocket connection depth), and counters for message flow/backpressure once instrumentation design settles.
  * `ServerConfig.metrics.bind_addr` is validated but unused - decide whether to spin a distinct metrics listener or drop the field before we freeze config.
  * WebSocket fan-out has no metrics/log correlation; plan to emit per-channel connection/change events (gated behind metrics feature) and capture queue depth/backpressure stats.
- Tests: `cargo test -p openguild-core`, `cargo test -p openguild-storage`, `cargo test -p openguild-server` (metrics gating optional). WebSocket integration test requires Tokio runtime (runs by default).
- Migrations: `backend/migrations/0001_initial.sql`, `0002_create_sessions.sql`, `0003_messaging.sql` (guilds/channels/channel_events schema).
- Docs touched: docs/SETUP.md (session key + DB persistence notes), docs/TIMELINE.md (Weeks 1-4 updated), docs/API.md (sessions + guild/channel/message routes + WebSocket), docs/PROTOCOL.md (event envelope + guardrails), docs/CI_PLAN.md (matrix outline).
- Tooling: top-level Makefile exposes `fmt`, `lint`, `check`, `test`, `test-metrics` targets.
- Outstanding follow-ups (pre-Week 5 checkpoints):
  * Lock observability approach: add request ID middleware + tracing propagation, ensure WebSocket upgrades inherit the same span/ID, and extend tests to capture log snapshots.
  * Flesh out metrics backlog (HTTP latency histograms, messaging counters/gauges, queue depth) and decide on naming/label strategy before wiring into `MetricsContext`.
  * Replace the in-memory authenticator with SQLx-backed credential storage once user schema exists; at that point revisit session issuance for refresh tokens/revocation.
  * Finalise payload validation/size limits + authz on messaging endpoints (currently trust arbitrary sender), coordinating with upcoming auth/session work.
- CI: see docs/CI_PLAN.md for matrix + scheduled jobs.

Notes for next agent (2025-10-13 01:19Z):
- Messaging CRUD/WebSocket stack is live; sync with frontend on any schema tweaks (sender identity, pagination cursors) as they build against docs/API.md.
- Prioritise observability sprint kickoff: introduce request ID/tracing layers, wire Prometheus metrics for HTTP + WebSocket flows, and capture regression tests (log snapshot + metrics scrape).
- Revisit `ServerConfig.metrics.bind_addr` usage before adding new listeners - either honour it (spawn secondary Axum server) or remove from config to avoid drift.
- Start drafting credential storage schema + migrations so auth hardening (refresh tokens, memberships) can follow; tee up openguild-storage interfaces for user tables.
- Readiness path keeps a pooled DB handle (StoragePool clone) while logging eager connect errors - preserve this behaviour when refactoring.
- CI plan lives in docs/CI_PLAN.md; workflows still missing.
- Use Makefile helpers (`make fmt`, `make lint`, `make check`, `make test`, `make test-metrics`) to keep the workspace tidy.
- Keep BRAIN.txt current; still our ad-hoc handoff channel.
