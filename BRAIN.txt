Context Snapshot (updated 2025-10-13 04:39Z)
-----------------------------------
- Backend focus: openguild-server crate (Rust, Axum).
- Config hierarchy: config files -> env (OPENGUILD_SERVER__) -> CLI flags.
- Key recent features:
  * Structured ServerConfig loader with metrics + log format options.
  * Prometheus-powered `/metrics` exporter under `--features metrics`, toggled via `OPENGUILD_SERVER__METRICS__ENABLED` (exports `openguild_http_requests_total` + `openguild_db_ready`).
  * Graceful shutdown helper with test-only Notify hook; `run()` now attempts DB connectivity (if DATABASE_URL set) and readiness reports database status (pending/configured/error).
  * CLI overrides via Clap (`--bind-addr`, `--host`, `--port`, `--log-format`, metrics flags, `--database-url`, `--session-signing-key`, `--server-name`).
  * ServerConfig now tracks a canonical `server_name` surfaced in event metadata; env/CLI wiring and docs were updated.
  * Storage crate now exposes a clonable `StoragePool` wrapper (`connect` returns it) plus a SQLx migration smoke test (skips if `OPENGUILD_TEST_DATABASE_URL`/`DATABASE_URL` unset).
  * Session module in `server` adds `/sessions/login` (JSON) with validation + signed responses using ed25519; backing store now persists to Postgres when a pool is available (falls back to in-memory for credentials-only mode).
  * Messaging core (Week 4): REST CRUD for guilds/channels, optimistic message persistence, and WebSocket fan-out with bounded broadcast/backpressure and replay window. In-memory fallback mirrors semantics when DATABASE_URL is absent.
  * `openguild-core::messaging` introduces message payload builders + proptests to ensure canonical event IDs remain unique; `openguild-storage::messaging` wires SQLx repositories for guilds/channels/events.
  * Event IDs now derive from the BLAKE3 hash of the canonical payload (base58 `$â€¦`); docs/API + PROTOCOL align with the implementation.
  * Metrics exporter honours `metrics.bind_addr` by spawning a dedicated Axum listener when configured; `/metrics` remains on the main router otherwise.
  * tower-http request ID middleware now runs globally: inbound `X-Request-Id` values are propagated, UUIDs are minted when absent, and responses always echo the header (docs updated).
  * Metrics recording now keys on `MatchedPath` instead of hard-coded strings, keeping Prometheus labels aligned with router definitions.
  * Messaging HTTP routes map missing resources to HTTP 404, preserve validation 400s, and record request metrics; docs/API updated to reflect new statuses.
  * Integration test (`websocket_broadcasts_events`) exercises fan-out via `tokio_tungstenite` to guard regressions.
- Week 5 observability prep:
  * Request IDs now flow through tracing/log spans for both HTTP requests and WebSocket upgrades (capture tests assert span enrichment + header propagation); still need to confirm downstream consumers adopt the header.
  * Added a tower-based latency recorder so `MetricsContext` captures duration histograms alongside counters; new messaging counters (delivered/no_subscribers/dropped) and WebSocket queue depth gauges surface via `/metrics` with coverage over append + broadcast paths.
  * `MetricsContext` grows latency histograms plus messaging/backpressure instruments; future work: fold remaining observability backlog (downstream audits, queue depth alerting, span sampling strategy).
  * WebSocket fan-out still needs correlation IDs in logs/traces and queue depth telemetry (metrics scaffolding now exists).
- Tests: `cargo test -p openguild-core`, `cargo test -p openguild-storage`, `cargo test -p openguild-server` (metrics gating optional). WebSocket integration test requires Tokio runtime (runs by default).
- Migrations: `backend/migrations/0001_initial.sql`, `0002_create_sessions.sql`, `0003_messaging.sql` (guilds/channels/channel_events schema).
- Docs touched: docs/SETUP.md (session key + DB persistence notes), docs/TIMELINE.md (Weeks 1-4 updated), docs/API.md (sessions + guild/channel/message routes + WebSocket), docs/PROTOCOL.md (event envelope + guardrails), docs/CI_PLAN.md (matrix outline).
- Tooling: top-level Makefile exposes `fmt`, `lint`, `check`, `test`, `test-metrics` targets.
- Outstanding follow-ups (pre-Week 5 checkpoints):
  * Lock observability approach: thread the new request IDs through tracing spans/log snapshots (HTTP + WebSocket) and extend tests to cover propagation.
  * Flesh out metrics backlog (HTTP latency histograms, messaging counters/gauges, queue depth) and decide on naming/label strategy before wiring into `MetricsContext`.
  * SQLx-backed credential storage now powers login when a database is configured; next up is wiring user registration flows (API + CLI seeding) and revisiting refresh token design.
  * Finalise payload validation/size limits + authz on messaging endpoints (currently trust arbitrary sender), coordinating with upcoming auth/session work.
- CI: see docs/CI_PLAN.md for matrix + scheduled jobs.

Notes for next agent (2025-10-13 04:39Z):
- Messaging CRUD/WebSocket stack is live; sync with frontend on any schema tweaks (sender identity, pagination cursors) as they build against docs/API.md.
- Prioritise observability sprint continuation: feed the new request IDs into tracing/log spans (HTTP + WebSocket), and capture regression tests (log snapshot + metrics scrape).
- Confirm downstream consumers handle the new BLAKE3/base58 event IDs and the 404 semantics introduced on messaging routes.
- Verify frontend/ops pipelines surface the emitted `X-Request-Id` header; document usage where necessary.
- Surface the new `server_name` configuration in deployment manifests so `origin_server` is stable across environments.
- Start drafting credential storage schema + migrations so auth hardening (refresh tokens, memberships) can follow; tee up openguild-storage interfaces for user tables.
- Readiness path keeps a pooled DB handle (StoragePool clone) while logging eager connect errors - preserve this behaviour when refactoring.
- CI plan lives in docs/CI_PLAN.md; workflows still missing.
- Use Makefile helpers (`make fmt`, `make lint`, `make check`, `make test`, `make test-metrics`) to keep the workspace tidy.
- Keep BRAIN.txt current; still our ad-hoc handoff channel.
